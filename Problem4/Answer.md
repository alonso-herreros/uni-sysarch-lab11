This solution satisfies the **mutual exclusion** requirement, since the critical section is
protected by a while loop that checks the value of the shared variable `turn` before enetering
the critical section. Since each process will only enter the critical section if the other process
has set `turn` to its own value, only one process can be in the critical section at a time.

This solution does not satisfy the **progress** requirement, since it is possible for a process to
be stuck in the while loop forever. If one process enters loop, it will change the value of the
turn `turn` variable, and the other process will _starve_.

This solution satisfies the **bounded waiting** requirement, since the process will wait until a
condition is met, and not indefinitely. The process will wait until the `turn` variable is set to
its required value, and then it will enter the critical section.
